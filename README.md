### Hi there 👋

I'm Ryan, an accomplished senior cybersecurity professional with a robust background encompassing 7+ years of expertise in networking, voice, system administration, cloud (AWS/Azure), and web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and popular libraries. I also have experience in popular DevOps tools with a particular interest in growing my DevSecOps knowledge so I can create and maintain DevSecOps pipelines using SCA, SAST, DAST, and Security as Code.

🧑‍💻 My current and developing skills are: 

- AWS Services 
- CI/CD (Jenkins)

- Configuration Management (Ansible)

Looking to dive into:

- IaC (AWS CloudFormation | Terraform)
- SCA, SAST & DAST

- Will also be puttig in more Python scripts too
  
Will create repos that reflect my interests where possible.
